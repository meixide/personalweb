Survival analysis is a fundamental area of focus in biomedical research, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. This prominence is due to the increasing prevalence of large and high-dimensional datasets, such as omics and medical image data. However, the literature on nonlinear regression algorithms and variable selection techniques for interval-censoring is either limited or nonexistent, particularly in the context of neural networks. Our objective is to introduce a novel predictive framework tailored for interval-censored regression tasks, rooted in Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models. Our strategy comprises two key components: (i) a variable selection phase leveraging recent advances on sparse neural network architectures; (ii) a regression model targeting prediction of the interval-censored response. To assess the performance of our novel algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation through both numerical experiments and real-world applications that encompass scenarios related to diabetes and physical activity. Our results outperform traditional AFT algorithms, particularly in scenarios featuring nonlinear relationships.
