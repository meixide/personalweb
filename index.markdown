I see mathematical statistics as a unifying framework in this time of scientific disruption brought by AI. While causal inference is often described as my research focus, I view it not as confined to a single area but as a thread running through the entire fabric of machine learning and statistics. My passion lies in deriving useful, abstract and elegant results that address data-driven problems arising in clinical medicine and epidemiology, fields undergoing their own quiet revolution.
